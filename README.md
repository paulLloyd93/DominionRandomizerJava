# Dominion Randomizer Application

  Hello and welcome to my Dominion Randomizer Application! This is a side project I have been working on while attending the coding boot camp, Tech Elevator. This application takes in a set of user parameters, and based on those options, pulls a randomized group of 10 cards from a database. These cards are from the deck-building card game Dominion! Learn more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game). 
  
  This application uses Java as its engine, utilizing a DAO pattern to access a PostgreSQL database and then randomize them! Currently, the user interacts with the application through the command-line, but in the future I am working on implementing a front-end to make it a lot prettier. As of now, I have added the first 2 expansions of the game's cards to my database, and the script is available in this repository as well. 
  
  This has been an amazing learning process for me and been so much fun, as I've actually used my own application to randomize my personal games of Dominion! Next steps will be implementing access to API using the Model-View-Controller pattern and eventually adding a JavaScript/Vue.js front-end.
  
  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just wanna chat about this application or computer programming in general!
